abstract: By conducting a questionnaire survey，this study examined the
  relationship between self-regulated learning strategies and academic
  achievement among 131 medical undergraduates who participated in an emergency
  online college English course at Naval Medical University. Findings suggested
  that strategies of effort，time/study en- vironment，metacognition，organization
  were positively correlated with academic achievement. The differences between
  the high-achieving group and the low-achieving group in the four strategies
  were statistically significant. Ac- cording to the research findings，the
  article puts forward corresponding teaching suggestions.
