abstract: The choice of assessment method is particularly important in English
  writing testing and assessment. Analytical assessment and holistic assessment
  are two common methods in English writing assessment. The choice of assessment
  method usually depends on the content and focus of the test. This paper
  provides a review of previous empirical studies and compares the two
  assessment methods in terms of reliability, construct validity,
  practicability, and impact, followed by suggestions in the selection, design,
  and operation of the assessment methods.
