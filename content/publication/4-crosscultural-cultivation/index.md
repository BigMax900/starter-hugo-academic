abstract: How to provide customized cross-cultural competence instruction
  according to the characteristics of learning subjects is an important topic in
  cross-cultural foreign language teaching. This study attempts to explore a
  college English teaching method based on the cultivation of cross-cultural
  competence of medical undergraduates. The study first clarifies the concept of
  cross-cultural competence of medical students, and combined with the learning
  theme, designs the classroom teaching of cross-cultural knowledge, attitude,
  and competence cultivation for teaching objects. Finally, this paper proposes
  that the integration of college English teaching and cross-cultural competence
  training of medical students should take into account characteristics of
  majors of teaching objects, create an empathetic learning environment, carry
  out research-based deep learning, and cultivate a global caring trend.
