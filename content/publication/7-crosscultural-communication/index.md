abstract: In order to build a global community of health for all, it is
  necessary to deeply understand the influencing factors of cross-cultural
  communication between medical professionals and patients. Factors such as
  different health beliefs, cultural values, and communication mediators
  influence cross-cultural communication between medical professionals and
  patients and then affect the medical satisfaction and treatment compliance.
  Medical education should adopt the learning concept of constructivism,
  advocate maintaining a humble cultural attitude, incorporate more patient
  perspectives and adopt cross-cultural teaching mode to improve the
  cross-cultural communication competence of medical students and medical staff,
  so as to establish relationship based on communication and understanding.
