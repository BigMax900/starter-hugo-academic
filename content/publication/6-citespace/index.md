abstract: "**Objective** To analyze the dynamics and changing characteristics of
  medical cultural competence education and to provide theoretical and practical
  references for medical culture education in China. **Methods** We searched the
  Web of Science core database with the keywords of “ medicine,” “ cultural
  competence,” and “ education” and obtained a total of 1 521 journal articles
  from 1992 to 2021. CiteSpace was employed to visualize and analyze the
  chronological distribution, publications on core journals, keywords, emergent
  terms, and research frontiers and hotspots of the literature. **Results** The
  number of papers published in the field of medical cultural competence
  education is steadily increasing. Developed Western countries contribute to
  the majority of the publications, especially America and Canada. Trending
  topics in the past five years are racial/ethnic culture and their differences.
  Compared with the research in Western countries, Chinese scholars are mainly
  interested in phenomenon description and case analysis but are inadequate in
  theoretical induction and exploration of local medical culture. **Conclusion**
  The research on cultural competence cultivation in medical education is
  increasingly mature. We can learn from the teaching methods and research focus
  of highly cited papers in this field and explore how to cultivate medical
  cultural competence suitable for our country’s conditions."
