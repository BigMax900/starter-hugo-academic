  In the past several decades, the compilation of learner corpora and the
  application of corpus linguistics have been extensively employed to improve
  learners’ use of logical connectors. However, the use of logical connectors in
  EFL learners’ spoken discourse remains under-researched. To investigate this
  field, the researcher built an EFL TESOL student spoken English corpus
  consisting of 27 spoken English samples of 12,241 words in total. Then, this
  study adopts corpus-based contrastive analysis and computer-aided error
  analysis to compare the tokens and the frequencies of the logical connectors
  with those in the native spoken English corpus of MICASE. Finally, underuse,
  overuse, and misuse in the TESOL student corpus were exemplified and
  explained.

  Findings reveal that the TESOL students tended to use a smaller set of logical connectors but used them more frequently than the English native speakers. Additive coordinating conjunctions such as and, so, and but were the most overused logical connectors. Moreover, the underuse of if, when, so that, and though shows that adverbial clauses were less frequently employed in their spoken discourse. A detailed explanation and pedagogical implications are also listed to help learners understand how to contextualize logical connectors at both syntactic and discourse level.
