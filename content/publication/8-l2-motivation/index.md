abstract: "**Objective** To investigate the relationship between foreign
  language learning motivation and academic performance of medical students in
  emergency remote teaching. **Methods** A total of 131 medical undergraduates
  from the Batch 2018 participated in this study. The motivation part in the
  \"motivated strategies for learning questionnaire (MSLQ)\" was used to test
  students' learning motivation. SPSS 27.0 was used for statistical analysis.
  Spearman correlation coefficient was used to describe the correlation between
  learning motivation and academic performance. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney U
  test was adopted to compare differences between students with different
  characteristics. **Results** ①There were strong positive correlations between
  learning beliefs, self-efficacy, goal orientation, and task value pairwise;
  ②self-efficacy and goal orientation were found to have significant positive
  correlations with academic achievement; ③the differences in self-efficacy and
  learning goals between high-achieving and low-achieving groups were
  statistically significant; ④there was no statistical difference in learning
  motivation between different gender groups. **Conclusion** Under the
  background of online learning, self-efficacy should be strengthened for
  English learning, making learning goals that focus on deep learning and
  improving the value of learning tasks and learning beliefs."
