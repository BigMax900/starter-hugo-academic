abstract: Oral presentations are widely adopted by language teachers in EFL
  classrooms to test language learners’ speaking capability, understanding of
  the topics covered in the course, or both (Mak, 2019). While many English as
  second/foreign language studies have examined the relationships between
  various factors and EFL learners’ speaking performance, few have investigated
  how those factors interact and jointly influence EFL learners’ oral
  presentation performance. Thus, this study aims to explore how the seven
  potential factors, including motivation (ideal L2 self and ought-to L2 self),
  grit, anxiety, and two strategies (pronunciation-oriented strategies and
  social-affective strategies), affect EFL learners’ oral presentation
  performance.
