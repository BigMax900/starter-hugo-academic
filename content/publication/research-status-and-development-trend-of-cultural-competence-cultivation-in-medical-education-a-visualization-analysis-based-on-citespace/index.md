abstract: "**Objective** To analyze the dynamics and changing characteristics of
  medical cultural competence education and provide theoretical and practical
  references for medical culture education in China. **Methods** In this paper,
  we searched the Web of Science core database with the keywords of “medicine,”
  “cultural competence,” and “education” and obtained a total of 1521 journal
  articles from 1992 to 2021. CiteSpace was employed to conduct the data
  visualization and analysis. **Results** The number of papers published in the
  field of medical cultural competence education is steadily increasing.
  Developed Western countries contribute to the majority of the publications,
  especially America and Canada. Trending topics in the past five years are
  racial/ethnic culture and their differences. Compared with the research in
  Western countries, Chinese scholars are mainly interested in phenomenon
  description and case analysis but are absent in theoretical induction and
  exploration. **Conclusion** The research on cultural competence cultivation in
  medical education is becoming increasingly mature. We can learn from the
  teaching methods and research focus of highly cited papers in this field and
  explore how to cultivate medical cultural competence suitable for our
  country’s conditions."
