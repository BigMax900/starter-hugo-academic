&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The choice of assessment method is particularly important in English writing testing and assessment. Analytical assessment and holistic assessment are two common methods in English writing assessment. The choice of assessment method usually depends on the content and focus of the test. This paper provides a review of previous empirical studies and compares the two assessment methods in terms of reliability, construct validity, practicability, and impact, followed by suggestions in the selection, design, and operation of the assessment methods.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
