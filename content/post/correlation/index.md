## 1. I﻿ntroduction

Correlation coefficients are used to measure how strong a relationship is between two variables. For example, when you want to evaluate how **students' learning hours** and **English learning performance** (i.e., grades) are related/correlated, correlation coefficients will indicate the strength of their relationship.

There are several types of correlation coefficient, but the most popular is **Pearson’s**. Pearson’s correlation (also called Pearson’s R) is a correlation coefficient commonly used in linear regression. If you’re starting out in statistics, you’ll probably learn about Pearson’s ***r*** first. In fact, when anyone refers to the correlation coefficient, they are usually talking about Pearson’s.

## 2﻿. Range of Correlation Coefficient

Correlation coefficient formulas are used to find how strong a relationship is between data. The formulas return a value between -1 and 1, where:

* (0, 1] indicates a strong positive relationship.
* [-1, 0) indicates a strong negative relationship.
* A result of zero indicates no relationship at all.

F﻿or example,

* I﻿f the coefficient between **students' learning hours** and **English learning performance** is 0.45, it means that the longer the students learn, the better their grades will be.

## 3﻿. Correlation Coefficient Formula

{{< math >}}
$$
r = \frac{n(\Sigma xy)-(\Sigma x)(\Sigma y)}{\sqrt{\[n \Sigma x^2-(\Sigma x)^2]\[n \Sigma y^2-(\Sigma y)^2]} }\
$$
{{< /math >}}

H﻿ere *x* can be **students' learning hours** and *y* can be **English learning performance.**
